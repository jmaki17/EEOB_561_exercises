AB  - In order to identify and quantify the microorganisms present in a certain ecosystem, it has become necessary to develop molecular methods avoiding cultivation, which allows to characterize only the countable part of the microorganisms in the sample, therefore losing the information related to the microbial component which presents a vitality condition, although it cannot duplicate in culture medium. In this context, one of the most used techniques is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probes. Owing to its speed and sensitivity, this technique is considered a powerful tool for phylogenetic, ecological, diagnostic and environmental studies in microbiology. Through the use of species-specific probes, it is possible to identify different microorganisms in complex microbial communities, thus providing a solid support to the understanding of inter-species interaction. The knowledge of the composition and distribution of microorganisms in natural habitats can be interesting for ecological reasons in microbial ecology, and for safety and technological aspects in food microbiology. Methodological aspects, use of different probes and applications of FISH to microbial ecosystems are presented in this review.

AU  - Lansdown, R.

AB  - There is no doubt that high blood lead levels are associated with mental subnormality and hyperactivity. Several recent studies in Britain and America have investigated the relation between moderate levels, i.e. between 20 and 40 microgram/100 ml and behavioural and cognitive phenomena. Epidemiological studies have generally failed to point to a clearcut relation between such levels and overactivity or decrements in performance on standard intelligence and educational tests. Published studies with the use of chelation techniques have suffered from methodological weaknesses. It is known that socio-economic factors are powerfully related to measured intelligence and behaviour and, on the evidence available, it is to them that attention should primarily be given if preventative measures are being considered. There remains the possibility that more refined test measures would detect impaired functioning in children with moderately raised lead levels, and that there is an interaction effect between lead and host resistance.

T2  - Systematic and Applied Microbiology
AB  - Although the number of phylotypes present in a microbial community may number in the hundreds or more, until recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization has been used to label, at most, only a handful of different phylotypes in a single sample. We recently developed a technique, CLASI-FISH for combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging - fluorescence in situ hybridization, to greatly expand the number of distinguishable taxa in a single FISH experiment. The CLASI technique involves labeling microbes of interest with combinations of probes coupled with spectral imaging to allow the use of fluorophores with highly overlapping excitation and emission spectra. Here, we present the basic principles and theory of CLASI-FISH along with some guidelines for performing CLASI-FISH experiments. We further include a protocol for creating fluorescence spectral reference standards, a vital component of successful CLASI-FISH.

AB  - Multispecies biofilms represent the dominant mode of life for the vast majority of microorganisms. Bacterial spatial localization in such biostructures governs ecological interactions between different populations and triggers the overall community functions. Here, we discuss the pros and cons of fluorescence-based techniques used to decipher bacterial species patterns in biofilms at single cell level, including fluorescence in situ hybridization and the use of genetically modified bacteria that express fluorescent proteins, reporting the significant improvements of those techniques. The development of tools for spatial and temporal study of multispecies biofilms will allow live imaging and spatial localization of cells in naturally occurring biofilms coupled with metabolic information, increasing insight of microbial community and the relation between its structure and functions.

AB  - The ribosomal-RNA (rRNA) approach to microbial evolution and ecology has become an integral part of environmental microbiology. Based on the patchy conservation of rRNA, oligonucleotide probes can be designed with specificities that range from the species level to the level of phyla or even domains. When these probes are labelled with fluorescent dyes or the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, they can be used to identify single microbial cells directly by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In this Review, we provide an update on the recent methodological improvements that have allowed more reliable quantification of microbial populations in situ in complex environmental samples, with a particular focus on the usefulness of group-specific probes in this era of ever-growing rRNA databases.

T2  - Journal of Microbiological Methods
AB  - Flow cytometry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization are common methods of identifying and quantifying bacterial cells. The combination of cytometric rapidity and multi-parametric accuracy with the phylogenetic specificity of oligonucleotide FISH probes has been regarded as a powerful and emerging tool in aquatic microbiology. In the present work, tests were carried out on E. coli pure culture and marine bacteria using an in-solution hybridization protocol revealing high efficiency hybridization signal for the first one and a lower for the second one. Other experiments were conducted on natural samples following the established CARD-FISH protocol on filter performed in a closed system, with the aim of improving cell detachment and detection. The hybridized cells were then subsequently re-suspended from the membrane filters by means of an optimized detachment procedure. The cytometric enumeration of hybridized marine bacteria reached 85.7%¬±18.1% of total events. The quality of the cytograms suggests that the procedures described may be applicable to the cytometric quantification of phylogenetic groups within natural microbial communities.

AB  - A new microscopic method for simultaneously determining in situ the identities, activities, and specific substrate uptake profiles of individual bacterial cells within complex microbial communities was developed by combining fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) performed with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes and microautoradiography. This method was evaluated by using defined artificial mixtures of Escherichia coli and Herpetosiphon aurantiacus under aerobic incubation conditions with added [3H]glucose. Subsequently, we were able to demonstrate the potential of this method by visualizing the uptake of organic and inorganic radiolabeled substrates ([14C]acetate, [14C]butyrate, [14C]bicarbonate, and 33Pi) in probe-defined populations from complex activated sludge microbial communities by using aerobic incubation conditions and anaerobic incubation conditions (with and without nitrate). For both defined cell mixtures and activated sludge, the method proved to be useful for simultaneous identification and analysis of the uptake of labeled substrates under the different experimental conditions used. Optimal results were obtained when fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides were applied prior to the microautoradiographic developing procedure. For single-cell resolution of FISH and microautoradiographic signals within activated sludge flocs, cryosectioned sample material was examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The combination of in situ rRNA hybridization techniques, cryosectioning, microautoradiography, and confocal laser scanning microscopy provides a unique opportunity for obtaining cultivation-independent insights into the structure and function of bacterial communities.

T2  - International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology
AB  - Strain MHT, a strictly anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, non-spore-forming, spherical coccus or coccoid-shaped microorganism, was isolated from a cow rumen during a screen for hexanoic acid-producing bacteria. The microorganism grew at 30-40‚Äâ¬∞C‚Äâand pH 5.5-7.5 and exhibited production of various short- and medium-chain carboxylic acids (acetic acid, butyric acid, pentanoic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid and octanoic acid), as well as H2 and CO2 as biogas. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that MHT represents a member of the genus Megasphaera, with the closest relatives being Megapsphaera indica NMBHI-10T (94.1‚Ää% 16S rRNA sequence similarity), Megasphaera elsdenii DSM 20460T (93.8‚Ää%) and Megasphaera paucivorans DSM 16981T (93.8‚Ää%). The major cellular fatty acids produced by MHT included C12‚Ää:‚Ää0, C16‚Ää:‚Ää0, C18‚Ää:‚Ää1cis 9, and C18‚Ää:‚Ää0, and the DNA G+C content of the MHT genome is 51.8‚Äâmol%. Together, the distinctive phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of MHT indicate that this microorganism represents a novel species of the genus Megasphaera, for which the name Megasphaera hexanoica sp. nov. is herein proposed. The type strain of this species is MHT (=KCCM 43214T=JCM 31403T).

AB  - Little is known about the significance of insects as environmental reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We characterized the antibiotic resistome of the microbial community in gypsy moth larval midguts by applying functional metagenomics to cultured isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 12 antibiotics were determined for 44 cultured isolates, and antibiotic resistance genes were selected from metagenomic libraries derived from DNA extracted from a pool of the isolates. Six unique clones were identified. Two were highly resistant to penicillin-type beta-lactams, two were moderately resistant to erythromycin, and two were moderately resistant to a range of antibiotics, including erythromycin, carbenicillin, and chloramphenicol. Sequence analysis predicted that the active genes encoded efflux pumps, a transcriptional activator of efflux pump protein expression, and an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase. Insect guts are a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes with the potential for dissemination.

AB  - A novel anaerobic, mesophilic, amino-acid-fermenting bacterium, designated strain CL-84(T), was isolated from the swine intestinal tract on mucin-based media. Cells were curved rods (0.8-1.2 √ó 3.5-5.0 ¬µm), stained Gram-negative and were non-motile with no evidence of spores. Strain CL-84(T) produced acetate, propionate, formate and butyrate as the end products of metabolism when grown on serine. Optimum growth occurred at 39 ¬∞C and pH 6.5. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C15:0 3-OH, iso-C17:0 and C16:0, distinguishing strain CL-84(T) from closely related species. The DNA G+C content of strain CL-84(T) was 55.1 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain CL-84(T) shared 90-95% similarity with characterized genera within the phylum Synergistetes, family Synergistaceae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain CL-84(T) was related to, but distinct from, Cloacibacillus evryensis. Based on these findings, we propose that strain CL-84(T) represents a novel species of the genus Cloacibacillus. We further propose the name Cloacibacillus porcorum sp. nov. be designated for this species. The type strain is CL-84(T) (=DSM 25858(T)=CCUG 62631(T)). An emended description of the genus Cloacibacillus is provided.

AB  - Two unknown, Gram-negative, catalase-negative and strictly anaerobic cocci were isolated from two independent human samples (strains AIP 49.01 and AIP 412.00T). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that these two organisms displayed 99.8% sequence identity and that they are members of the Sporomusa sub-branch of the low-G + C Gram-positive bacteria. The most closely related 16S rDNA sequences were from Megasphaera sp. oral clone BU057 (99.8%) and from isolates of Megasphaera cerevisiae and Megasphaera elsdenii (94.5 and 93.8%, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that these two strains were most closely related to M. elsdenii and belonged to the Megasphaera genus. Differences from previously described Megasphaera species in terms of size, biochemical tests (particularly the analysis of metabolic end products), gas production and DNA G+C content indicated that the two strains studied represent a novel species of anaerobic Gram-negative cocci. The name Megasphaera micronuciformis sp. nov. is proposed for these two isolates. It is also proposed that the uncultured organism previously deposited as Megasphaera sp. oral clone BU057 should be named 'Candidatus Megasphaera micronuciformis'. The type strain of Megasphaera micronuciformis is AIP 412.00T (=CIP 107280T =CCUG 45952T).

AB  - Two coccoid, non-motile, obligately anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative bacteria, occurring singly or in pairs, or as short chains, with a mean size of 1.4-2.5 ¬µm were isolated from the faeces of two healthy human volunteers, aged 26 and 56 years, and were designated NMBHI-10(T) and BLPYG-7, respectively. Both the strains were affiliated to the sub-branch Sporomusa of the class Clostridia as revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The isolates NMBHI-10(T) and BLPYG-7 showed 99.1 and 99.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively, with Megasphaera elsdenii JCM 1772(T). DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic analysis showed that both the strains were distinct from their closest relative, M. elsdenii JCM 1772(T) (42 and 53% DNA-DNA relatedness with NMBHI-10(T) and BLPYG-7, respectively), but belong to the same species (DNA-DNA relatedness of 80.9‚Ää% between the isolates). According to DNA-DNA hybridization results, the coccoid strains belong to the same genospecies, and neither is related to any of the recognized species of the genus Megasphaera. Strains NMBHI-10(T) and BLPYG-7 grew in PYG broth at temperatures of between 15 and 40 ¬∞C (optimum 37 ¬∞C), but not at 45 ¬∞C. The strains utilized a range of carbohydrates as sources of carbon and energy including glucose, lactose, cellobiose, rhamnose, galactose and sucrose. Glucose fermentation resulted in the formation of volatile fatty acids, mainly caproic acid and organic acids such as succinic acid. Phylogenetic analysis, specific phenotypic characteristics and/or DNA G+C content also differentiated the strains from each other and from their closest relatives. The DNA G+C contents of strains NMBHI-10(T) and BLPYG-7 are 57.7 and 54.9 mol%, respectively. The major fatty acids were 12 : 0 FAME and 17 : 0 CYC FAME. On the basis of these data, we conclude that strains NMBHI-10(T) and BLPYG-7 should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Megasphaera, for which the name Megsphaera indica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NMBHI-10(T) (‚Ää= DSM 25563(T)‚Ää= MCC 2481(T)).

AB  - Seven unidentified strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacteria from spoiled beer or the brewery environment were characterized. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, all strains were affiliated to the Sporomusa sub-branch of the class 'Clostridia'. Three of the strains were non-motile cocci, on average 1.5 x 1.2 microm or 1.2 x 1.0 microm, occurring mainly singly or in pairs. They shared nearly identical (>99 %) 16S rRNA gene sequences, being most closely related to the species of the Megasphaera-Anaeroglobus group (< or =93.9 % similarity). According to DNA-DNA hybridization results, the coccoid strains represented two genospecies, neither of which was related to any of the recognized Megasphaera species. Several phenotypic characteristics and/or DNA G+C content also differentiated the strains from each other and from their closest relatives. The other four novel strains were motile, slightly curved to helical rods, 0.6-0.8 x 3-50 microm or more in size. They shared identical 16S rRNA gene sequences and ribofragment patterns. The highest 16S rRNA gene similarity was found between these isolates and Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus ATCC 29359T (95.6 %) and Pectinatus frisingensis ATCC 33332T (93.6 %). The novel strains also differed from recognized Pectinatus species in their sugar utilization, proteolytic activity, catalase activity, antibiotic resistance and temperature tolerance. The results suggest that the bacteria belong to three novel species, for which the names Megasphaera paucivorans sp. nov. (type strain VTT E-032341T = DSM 16981T), Megasphaera sueciensis sp. nov. (type strain VTT E-97791T = DSM 17042T) and Pectinatus haikarae sp. nov. (type strain VTT E-88329T = DSM 16980T) are proposed.

AB  - Thin sectioning and freeze-fracture-etch of the ovine ruminal isolate Mitsuokella multacida strain 46/5(2) revealed a Gram-negative envelope ultra-structure consisting of a peptidoglycan wall overlaid by an outer membrane. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis of whole cells, cell envelopes and Triton X-100 extracted envelopes in combination with thin-section and N-terminal sequence analyses demonstrated that the outer membrane contained two major proteins (45 and 43 kDa) sharing identical N-termini (A-A-N-P-F-S-D-V-P-A-D-H-W-A-Y-D). A gene encoding a protein with a predicted N-terminus identical to those of the 43 and 45 kDa outer-membrane proteins was cloned. The 1290 bp open reading frame encoded a 430 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 47,492 Da. Cleavage of a predicted 23 amino acid leader sequence would yield a protein with a molecular mass of 45,232 Da. Mass spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the cloned gene (ompM1) encoded the 45 kDa outer-membrane protein. The N-terminus of the mature OmpM1 protein (residues 24-70) shared homology with surface-layer homology (SLH) domains found in a wide variety of regularly structured surface-layers (S-layers). However, the outer-membrane locale, resistance to denaturation by SDS and high temperatures and the finding that the C-terminal residue was a phenylalanine suggested that ompM1 encoded a porin. Threading analysis in combination with the identification of membrane spanning domains indicated that the C-terminal region of OmpM1 (residues 250-430) likely forms a 16-strand beta-barrel and appears to be related to the unusual N-terminal SLH-domain-containing beta-barrel-porins previously described in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC6301.

AB  - Sodium butyrate is a sodium salt of a volatile short-chain fatty acid (butyric acid) used to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis infection in birds. Three groups of fifty 1-d-old broilers each were fed the following diets: T0 = standard broiler diet (control); T1 = standard broiler diet supplemented with 0.92 g/kg of an additive with free sodium butyrate (Gustor XXI B92); and T2 = standard broiler diet supplemented with 0.92 g/kg of an additive with sodium butyrate partially protected with vegetable fats (Gustor XXI BP70). Twenty percent of the birds were orally infected with Salmonella Enteritidis at d 5 posthatching and fecal Salmonella shedding was assessed at d 6, 9, 13, 20, 27, 34, and 41 of the trial. At d 42, all birds were slaughtered and 20 of them dissected: crop, cecum, liver, and spleen were sampled for bacteriological analyses. Both butyrate-based additives showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) of Salmonella Enteritidis infection in birds from d 27 onward. However, the partially protected butyrate additive was more effective at the late phase of infection. Partially protected butyrate treatment successfully decreased infection not only in the crop and cecum but also in the liver. There were no differences in the spleen. These results suggest that sodium butyrate partially protected with vegetable fats offers a unique balance of free and protected active substances effective all along the gastrointestinal tract because it is slowly released during digestion.

AB  - With increasing number of novel bacteria being isolated from the human gut ecosystem, there is a greater need to study their role in the gut ecosystem and their effect on the host health. In the present study, we carried out in silico genome-wide analysis of two novel Megasphaera sp. isolates NM10 (DSM25563) and BL7 (DSM25562), isolated from feces of two healthy individuals and validated the key features by in vitro studies. The analysis revealed the general metabolic potential, adaptive features and the potential effects of these isolates on the host. The comparative genome analysis of the two human gut isolates NM10 and BL7 with ruminal isolate Megasphaera elsdenii (DSM20460) highlighted the differential adaptive features for their survival in human gut. The key findings include features like bile resistance, presence of various sensory and regulatory systems, stress response systems, membrane transporters and resistance to antibiotics. Comparison of the "glycobiome" based on the genomes of the ruminal isolate with the human gut isolates NM10 and BL revealed the presence of diverse and unique sets of Carbohydrate-Active enzymes (CAZymes) amongst these isolates, with a higher collection of CAZymes in the human gut isolates. This could be attributed to the difference in host diet and thereby the environment, consequently suggesting host specific adaptation in these isolates. In silico analysis of metabolic potential predicted the ability of these isolates to produce important metabolites like short chain fatty acids (butyrate, acetate, formate, and caproate), vitamins and essential amino acids, which was further validated by in vitro experiments. The ability of these isolates to produce important metabolites advocates for a potential healthy influence on the host. Further in vivo studies including transcriptomic and proteomic analysis will be required for better understanding the role and impact of these Megasphaera sp. isolates NM10 and BL7 on the human host.

AB  - Studying the host-associated butyrate-producing bacterial community is important, because butyrate is essential for colonic homeostasis and gut health. Previous research has identified the butyryl coenzyme A (CoA):acetate-CoA transferase (EC 2.3.8.3) as a gene of primary importance for butyrate production in intestinal ecosystems; however, this gene family (but) remains poorly defined. We developed tools for the analysis of butyrate-producing bacteria based on 12 putative but genes identified in the genomes of nine butyrate-producing bacteria obtained from the swine intestinal tract. Functional analyses revealed that eight of these genes had strong But enzyme activity. When but paralogues were found within a genome, only one gene per genome encoded strong activity, with the exception of one strain in which no gene encoded strong But activity. Degenerate primers were designed to amplify the functional but genes and were tested by amplifying environmental but sequences from DNA and RNA extracted from swine colonic contents. The results show diverse but sequences from swine-associated butyrate-producing bacteria, most of which clustered near functionally confirmed sequences. Here, we describe tools and a framework that allow the bacterial butyrate-producing community to be profiled in the context of animal health and disease.
IMPORTANCE: Butyrate is a compound produced by the microbiota in the intestinal tracts of animals. This compound is of critical importance for intestinal health, and yet studying its production by diverse intestinal bacteria is technically challenging. Here, we present an additional way to study the butyrate-producing community of bacteria using one degenerate primer set that selectively targets genes experimentally demonstrated to encode butyrate production. This work will enable researchers to more easily study this very important bacterial function that has implications for host health and resistance to disease.

AB  - It is known that volatile fatty acids can inhibit growth of species of the family Enterobacteriaceae in vitro. However, whether these volatile fatty acids affect bacterial populations in the ceca of chickens is unknown. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate if changes in volatile fatty acids in ceca of broiler chickens during growth affect bacterial populations. Results showed that members of the Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci are present in large numbers in 3-day-old broilers and start to decrease when broilers grow older. Lactobacilli are present in large numbers as well in 3-day-old broilers, but they remain stable during the growth of broilers. Acetate, butyrate, and propionate increase from undetectable levels in 1-day-old broilers to high concentrations in 15-day-old broilers, after which they stabilize. Significant negative correlations could be calculated between numbers of Enterobacteriaceae and concentrations of undissociated acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Furthermore, pure cultures of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from the ceca were grown in the presence of volatile fatty acids. Growth rates and maximal optical density decreased when these strains grew in the presence of increasing volatile fatty acid concentrations. It is concluded that volatile fatty acids are responsible for the reduction in numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in the ceca of broiler chickens during growth.

AU  - Kaizu, T.

T2  - Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta
AB  - A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8) cells. However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 37 degrees C for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone.

AB  - The effect of the major metabolite of aspirin, namely salicylic acid, upon the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells has been studied. Salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the amount present. At any concentration of this substance there was greater inhibition of the PPP in G6PD-deficient than in normal red cells.

AB  - When mixed cultures containing sporeforming bacteria were treated with heat or with ethanol, the latter consistently resulted in better recovery of Clostridium and Bacillus species. Both techniques were effective in eliminating vegetative cells. An ethanol concentration greater than 25% and exposure for 45 min or longer were necessary to kill all vegetative cells in mixed-culture samples. Ethanol treatment (50% ethanol for 1 h) was effective for isolating sporeforming bacteria from intestinal specimens. Seven different species of Clostridium were the only bacteria isolated from the ethanol-treated specimen of intestinal contents from the large bowel of a patient. It was concluded that treatment with ethanol for 1 h is an effective technique for selective isolation of sporeforming bacteria from mixed cultures and certain types of clinical specimens.

T2  - Amino Acids
AB  - This study determined the utilization of amino acids (AA) by bacteria from the lumen of the pig small intestine. Digesta samples from different segments of the small intestine were inoculated into media containing 10 mmol/L each of select AA (L-lysine, L-threonine, L-arginine, L-glutamate, L-histidine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-proline, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine or L-tryptophan) and incubated for 24 h. The previous 24-h culture served as an inoculum for a subsequent 24-h subculture during each of 30 subcultures. Results of the in vitro cultivation experiment indicated that the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, arginine, threonine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, valine or histidine were 50-90% in the duodenum, jejunum or ileum groups. After 30 subcultures, the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, threonine, arginine or glutamate remained greater than 50%. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that Streptococcus sp., Mitsuokella sp., and Megasphaera elsdenii-like bacteria were predominant in subcultures for utilizing lysine, threonine, arginine and glutamate. In contrast, Klebsiella sp. was not a major user of arginine or glutamate. Furthermore, analysis of AA composition and the incorporation of AA into polypeptides indicated that protein synthesis was a major pathway for AA metabolism in all the bacteria studied. The current work identified the possible predominant bacterial species responsible for AA metabolism in the pig small intestine. The findings provide a new framework for future studies to characterize the metabolic fate of AA in intestinal microbes and define their nutritional significance for both animals and humans.

AU  - Stanton, Thaddeus B.

T2  - Applied and Environmental Microbiology
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria insensitive to chlortetracycline (64 to 256 microg/ml) were isolated from cecal contents and cecal tissues of swine fed or not fed chlortetracycline. A nutritionally complex, rumen fluid-based medium was used for culturing the bacteria. Eight of 84 isolates from seven different animals were identified as Megasphaera elsdenii strains based on their large-coccus morphology, rapid growth on lactate, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence similarities with M. elsdenii LC-1(T). All eight strains had tetracycline MICs of between 128 and 256 microg/ml. Based on PCR assays differentiating 14 tet classes, the strains gave a positive reaction for the tet(O) gene. By contrast, three ruminant M. elsdenii strains recovered from 30-year-old culture stocks had tetracycline MICs of 4 microg/ml and did not contain tet genes. The tet genes of two tetracycline-resistant M. elsdenii strains were amplified and cloned. Both genes bestowed tetracycline resistance (MIC = 32 to 64 microg/ml) on recombinant Escherichia coli strains. Sequence analysis revealed that the M. elsdenii genes represent two different mosaic genes formed by interclass (double-crossover) recombination events involving tet(O) and tet(W). One or the other genotype was present in each of the eight tetracycline-resistant M. elsdenii strains isolated in these studies. These findings suggest a role for commensal bacteria not only in the preservation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the intestinal tract but also in the evolution of resistance.

AB  - We identified a crypt-specific core microbiota (CSCM) dominated by strictly aerobic, nonfermentative bacteria in murine cecal and proximal colonic (PC) crypts and hypothesized that, among its possible functions, it may affect epithelial regeneration. In the present work, we isolated representative CSCM strains using selective media based upon our initial 16S rRNA-based molecular identification (i.e., Acinetobacter, Delftia, and Stenotrophomonas). Their tropism for the crypt was confirmed, and their influence on epithelial regeneration was demonstrated in vivo by monocolonization of germfree mice. We also showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), through its endotoxin activity, was the dominant bacterial agonist controlling proliferation. The relevant molecular mechanisms were analyzed using colonic crypt-derived organoids exposed to bacterial sonicates or highly purified LPS as agonists. We identified a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent program affecting crypts at different stages of epithelial differentiation. LPS played a dual role: it repressed cell proliferation through RIPK3-mediated necroptosis of stem cells and cells of the transit-amplifying compartment and concurrently enhanced cell differentiation, particularly the goblet cell lineage.IMPORTANCE The LPS from crypt-specific core microbiota controls intestinal epithelium proliferation through necroptosis of stem cells and enhances cell differentiation, mainly the goblet cell lineage.

AB  - Chicken is a major food source for humans, hence it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in nutrient absorption in chicken. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), the microbiota plays a central role in enhancing nutrient absorption and strengthening the immune system, thereby affecting both growth and health of chicken. There is little information on the diversity and functions of chicken GIT microbiota, its impact on the host, and the interactions between the microbiota and host. Here, we review the recent metagenomic strategies to analyze the chicken GIT microbiota composition and its functions related to improving metabolism and health. We summarize methodology of metagenomics in order to obtain bacterial taxonomy and functional inferences of the GIT microbiota and suggest a set of indicator genes for monitoring and manipulating the microbiota to promote host health in future.

AU  - Vital, Marius

T2  - mBio
AB  - Butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type II diabetes. This guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. However, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. We undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3,184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the Integrated Microbial Genome database. Genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. The majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the Firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. The established gene catalogue (3,055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the HMP (Human Microbiome Project) consortium. A high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1%; range, 3.2% to 39.4%), where the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7% of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2%). Diversity analysis for the acetyl-CoA pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with Bacteroidetes. IMPORTANCE Microbiome research has revealed new, important roles of our gut microbiota for maintaining health, but an understanding of effects of specific microbial functions on the host is in its infancy, partly because in-depth functional microbial analyses are rare and publicly available databases are often incomplete/misannotated. In this study, we focused on production of butyrate, the main energy source for colonocytes, which plays a critical role in health and disease. We have provided a complete database of genes from major known butyrate-producing pathways, using in-depth genomic analysis of publicly available genomes, filling an important gap to accurately assess the butyrate-producing potential of complex microbial communities from "-omics"-derived data. Furthermore, a reference data set containing the abundance and diversity of butyrate synthesis pathways from the healthy gut microbiota was established through a metagenomics-based assessment. This study will help in understanding the role of butyrate producers in health and disease and may assist the development of treatments for functional dysbiosis.

AB  - Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the end products of fermentation of dietary fibers by the anaerobic intestinal microbiota, have been shown to exert multiple beneficial effects on mammalian energy metabolism. The mechanisms underlying these effects are the subject of intensive research and encompass the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and host energy metabolism. This review summarizes the role of SCFAs in host energy metabolism, starting from the production by the gut microbiota to the uptake by the host and ending with the effects on host metabolism. There are interesting leads on the underlying molecular mechanisms, but there are also many apparently contradictory results. A coherent understanding of the multilevel network in which SCFAs exert their effects is hampered by the lack of quantitative data on actual fluxes of SCFAs and metabolic processes regulated by SCFAs. In this review we address questions that, when answered, will bring us a great step forward in elucidating the role of SCFAs in mammalian energy metabolism.

AB  - The effects of sodium butyrate and sodium bromo-octanoate (an inhibitor of beta oxidation) on colonic mucus glycoprotein (mucin) synthesis have been assessed using tissue from colonic resection samples. Epithelial biopsy specimens were incubated for 16 hours in RPMI 1640 with glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and N-acetyl-[3H]-glucosamine ([3H]-Glc NAc), and differing concentrations of sodium butyrate. Incorporation of [3H] Glc NAc into mucin by normal epithelium at least 10 cm distant from colonic cancer was increased in the presence of sodium butyrate in a dose dependent manner, with maximum effect (476%) at a concentration of 0.1 mM (number of specimens = 24 from six patients, p < 0.001). The increase in response to butyrate was not seen when specimens were incubated in the presence of the beta oxidation inhibitor sodium bromo-octanoate 0.05 M. The striking increase in mucin synthesis that results when butyrate is added to standard nutrient medium suggests that this may be an important mechanism affecting the rate of mucin synthesis in vivo and may also explain the therapeutic effect of butyrate in colitis.

AB  - The short fatty acid, butyrate, which is produced by intestinal anaerobic bacteria in the colon, has inhibitory activity on histone deacetylases (HDACs). Treatment of the human colon cancer cell line, LS174T, with 1-2 mM sodium butyrate stimulated MUC2 mucin production, as determined by histological PAS staining of carbohydrate chains of mucin, and confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels by immunoblotting with anti-MUC2 antibody and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Increases in acetylated histone H3 in the LS174T cells treated with butyrate suggest inhibition of HDACs in these cells. Butyrate-stimulated MUC2 production in the LS174T cells was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, implicating the involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades in this process. Proliferation of the LS174T cells was inhibited by butyrate treatment. Although apoptotic nuclear DNA fragmentation could not be detected, cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the butyrate-treated cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry. Thus butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor, inhibits proliferation of LS174T cells but stimulates MUC2 production in individual cells.

TI  - LoRDEC: accurate and efficient long read error correction
AU  - Salmela, Leena

T2  - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)
AB  - MOTIVATION: PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing is a third-generation sequencing technique producing long reads, with comparatively lower throughput and higher error rate. Errors include numerous indels and complicate downstream analysis like mapping or de novo assembly. A hybrid strategy that takes advantage of the high accuracy of second-generation short reads has been proposed for correcting long reads. Mapping of short reads on long reads provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to 99% of errors, however, at the expense of prohibitive running times and considerable amounts of disk and memory space.
RESULTS: We present LoRDEC, a hybrid error correction method that builds a succinct de Bruijn graph representing the short reads, and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long reads by traversing chosen paths in the graph. In comparison, LoRDEC is at least six times faster and requires at least 93% less memory or disk space than available tools, while achieving comparable accuracy. Availability and implementaion: LoRDEC is written in C++, tested on Linux platforms and freely available at http://atgc.lirmm.fr/lordec.

T2  - Applied Microbiology
AB  - A method for the preparation and gas chromatographic analysis of the butyl esters of volatile (C-1-C-7) and nonvolatile (lactic, succinic, and fumaric) acids in microbial fermentation media is presented. Butyl esters were prepared from the dry salts of the acids. The esters were separated by temperature programming on a column of Chromosorb W coated with Dexsil 300 GC liquid phase and analyzed with a flame ionization detector. Apparent recoveries with butanol-HCl or butanol-H2SO4 as butylating agents were 80 to 90% for most acids. Chromatographic profiles of the butyl esters demonstrated that both volatile and nonvolatile acids can be detected and separated in 24 min on a single column. Standard calibration curves (peak area versus concentration) of the butyl esters were linear in the range of 5 to 40 mumol of acid per ml. The advantages of using an internal standard (heptanoic acid) for quantitating fatty acids in a mixture are given. Chromatograms of butylated fermentation media in which rumen anaerobic bacteria were grown illustrated that this method is useful for determining short-chain volatile and nonvolatile acids of toxonomic significance.

AB  - The Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is the bacterial Bioinformatics Resource Center (https://www.patricbrc.org). Recent changes to PATRIC include a redesign of the web interface and some new services that provide users with a platform that takes them from raw reads to an integrated analysis experience. The redesigned interface allows researchers direct access to tools and data, and the emphasis has changed to user-created genome-groups, with detailed summaries and views of the data that researchers have selected. Perhaps the biggest change has been the enhanced capability for researchers to analyze their private data and compare it to the available public data. Researchers can assemble their raw sequence reads and annotate the contigs using RASTtk. PATRIC also provides services for RNA-Seq, variation, model reconstruction and differential expression analysis, all delivered through an updated private workspace. Private data can be compared by 'virtual integration' to any of PATRIC's public data. The number of genomes available for comparison in PATRIC has expanded to over 80 000, with a special emphasis on genomes with antimicrobial resistance data. PATRIC uses this data to improve both subsystem annotation and k-mer classification, and tags new genomes as having signatures that indicate susceptibility or resistance to specific antibiotics.
